**Cybersecurity** is the protection of computer systems from:
* Vandals
* Activists
* Criminals
* States

**Security goals**:
* Confidentiality - Attacks: eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle.
* Integrity - Attacks: masquerading, message tampering, replaying.
* Availability - Attacks: Denial of Service, distributed denial of service.

**Security principles**:
* Economy of Mechanism - Keep it simple
    * General engineering principle: Complex designs yields complex failure analysis.
* Open design: Systems are hard to buildâ€”more scrutiny, less defects.
* Minimum exposure: Minimise the attack surface a system presents to
the adversary.
    * Limit information
    * Limit window of opportunity
    * Reduce external interfaces
* Least privilege: Any component should operate using the least set of privileges necessary.
* Fail-safe defaults: The system should start in and return to a secure state in the event of a failure.
* Complete mediation: Access to any object must be monitored and controlled.
* No single point of failure: Build redundant security mechanisms whenever feasible.
* Psychological acceptability: Design usable security mechanisms.
